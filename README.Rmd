The goal of XenaShiny is to provide a web app for downloading, analyzing and visulizing datasets from [UCSC Xena](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/), which is a collection of UCSC-hosted public databases such as TCGA, ICGC, TARGET, GTEx, CCLE, and others. Databases are normalized so they can be combined, linked, filtered, explored and downloaded.
