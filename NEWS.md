# UCSCXenaShiny 2.0.0

## New Features

https://github.com/openbiox/UCSCXenaShiny/commit/147f4612943df940d3bbd409e82a492dfce37cb4

### Datasets

- `load_data("tcga_PW")`: ssGSEA scores of HALLMARK, KEGG, IOBR terms for TCGA samples.
- `load_data("tcga_PW_meta")`: metadata annotation for HALLMARK, KEGG, IOBR terms.
- `load_data("pcawg_TIL")`: PCAWG TIL data.
- `load_data("pcawg_PW")`: ssGSEA scores of HALLMARK, KEGG, IOBR terms for PCAWG samples.

### R Package Functions

- `.opt_pancan` : Default setting for alternative TPC datasets.
- `mol_quick_analysis()`: Quick molecule analysis and report generation based on TCGA dataset.
- `query_tcga_group()`: Group TPC samples by build-in or custom phenotype and support filtering or merging operations.
- `vis_dim_dist()`: Visualize the distribution difference of TCGA samples after dimension reduction analysis.
- `vis_identifier_dim_dist()`: Visualize the distribution difference of samples after Molecule Identifier dimension reduction analysis.
- `vis_toil_Mut()`: Visualize molecular profile difference between mutation and wild status of queried gene.
- `vis_toil_Mut_cancer()`: Visualize molecular profile difference between mutation and wild status of queried gene in Single Cancer Type

### Shiny application

- Homepage
  - Added slicker gallery to display page summary;
  - Added report generation for TCGA pan-cancer exploration.
  
- General Dataset  Analysis

  - Added one general dimension reduction analysis module.

- Quick TPC Analysis

  - Added one module for association analysis between molecule and pathway;
  - Added one module for association analysis between molecule and mutation;
  - Added one module for dimension reduction analysis.

- Personalized Analysis

  - Designed personalized TPC analysis pipelines for based on 3 methods and 3 modes.

- Download

  - Added two modules for exact subset of integrated TPC data and UCSCXena datasets.

## Enhancements

- Supported getting more flexible methylation value.

```r
UCSCXenaShiny::get_pancan_methylation_value(
  "RCAN2",
  rule_out = c("cg21115430", "cg19452802"), 
  aggr = "Q75"
)
```

- Supported installing the package from r-universe (<https://openbiox.r-universe.dev/UCSCXenaShiny>).

- Supported alternative molecular profiling datasets for quick and personalized TPC analysis.

## Bug Fixes

- Merged data with unequal size in pan-cancer data query with a gene signature (#283), the fix also enhance the sample names match.

Test code:

```r
vis_gene_tmb_cor("`ZFAT-AS1` + `SNORD116-1` + SPATA31D1", data_type = "methylation")
```
