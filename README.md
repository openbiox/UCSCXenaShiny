The goal of XenaShiny is to provide a web app for downloading, analyzing
and visulizing datasets from [UCSC
Xena](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/), which is a collection of
UCSC-hosted public databases such as TCGA, ICGC, TARGET, GTEx, CCLE, and
others. Databases are normalized so they can be combined, linked,
filtered, explored and downloaded.
