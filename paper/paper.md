UCSC Xena platform (https://xenabrowser.net/) provides unprecedented resource for public omics data [@goldman2019ucsc]
from big projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [@weinstein2013cancer], 
International Cancer Genome Consortium Data Portal (ICGC) [@zhang2011international],
The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) [@barretina2012cancer], or reserach groups like @mullighan2008genomic, @puram2017single.
All available data types include single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions and deletions (INDELs), large structural variants, copy number variation (CNV), expression, DNA methylation, ATAC-seq signals, and phenotypic annotations.
